## Hi, this is a project that I am making because I really like sumo.


## I have become inspired by all of the different applications that I have seen made with the sumo-api and I wanted to create my own application.

## I will add this to my professional portfolio, as I have just finished a full stack bootcamp and needed to start making many different applications.

## This will help me build my foundations when working with an api and running a live service application.

## Features that I would like to add

# - I would like to add a minigame by picking different wrestlers and getting points for every win, add a leaderboard and private basho capabilities so people can have fantasy teams with their sumo friends.

# - I will add the different statistics of active wrestlers and the histories of their bouts.

# - Create profiles for the wrestlers

# - login / sign up 

# - use service workers to remember your favorite sumo and so even if you don't select your picks before the basho, you will be entered into the contest.

# - Add sumo news page (if possible )

# - beautiful homepage
